Graph machine learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves using graph structures to represent data and learn from it. It is a type of deep learning that focuses on modeling complex relationships and dependencies between entities in a graph. 
The project started with covering theoretical aspects of algorithms like Graph Kernels, DeepWalk, and node2vec and moves on to more sophisticated techniques like Graph Neural Networks and Graph Convolutional Networks. 
In the end we worked on a Collab Notebook and completed it using the knowledge gained across the course.
